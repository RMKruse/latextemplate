 abstract = {This article studies model averaging for linear mixed-effects models. We establish an unbiased estimator of the squared risk for the model averaging, and use the estimator as a criterion for choosing weights. The resulting model average estimator is proved to be asymptotically optimal under some regularity conditions. Simulation experiments show it is superior or comparable to estimators based on the final models selected by the commonly-used methods and some existing averaging procedures. The proposed procedure is applied to data from an AIDS clinic trial.},

 abstract = {Model selection in mixed models based on the conditional distribution is appropriate for many practical applications and has been a focus of recent statistical research. In this paper we introduce the R-package cAIC4 that allows for the computation of the conditional Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC). Computation of the conditional AIC needs to take into account the uncertainty of the random effects variance and is therefore not straightforward. We introduce a fast and stable implementation for the calculation of the cAIC for linear mixed models estimated with lme4 and additive mixed models estimated with gamm4 . Furthermore, cAIC4 offers a stepwise function that allows for a fully automated stepwise selection scheme for mixed models based on the conditional AIC. Examples of many possible applications are presented to illustrate the practical impact and easy handling of the package.},

@article{Liang.2008,
 abstract = {The conventional model selection criterion AIC has been applied to choose candidate models in mixed-effects models by the consideration of marginal likelihood. Vaida and Blanchard (2005) demonstrated that such a marginal AIC and its small sample correction are inappropriate when the research focus is on clusters. Correspondingly, these authors suggested to use conditional AIC. The conditional AIC is derived under the assumptions of the variance-covariance matrix or scaled variance-covariance matrix of random effects being known. We develop a general conditional AIC but without these strong assumptions. This allows Vaida and Blanchard's conditional AIC to be applied in a wide range. Simulation studies show that the proposed method is promising.},

 abstract = {In linear mixed models, model selection frequently includes the selection of random effects. Two versions ofthe Akaike information criterion, AIC, have been used, based either on the marginal or on the conditional distribution.We show that the marginal AIC is not an asymptotically unbiased estimator ofthe Akaike information, and favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional AIC, we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that can lead to the selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional AIC, which avoids the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations. An implementation in an R package (R Development Core Team, 2010) is provided. All theoretical results are illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia.},

@article{Cederbaum.,
 abstract = {Technological advances allow today's scientists in various fields to collect an increasing amount of data consisting of functional observations rather than single data points. Intense research in statistical methodology for functional data during the last years has aimed at developing methods that exploit the whole potential of this type of data. Many of the proposed approaches assume that the functional observations are independent. This may be very restrictive in practice, where correlation is frequently induced by, e.g., repeated observations per subject or grouping in the data.

The main focus of this thesis is on the analysis of functional data with complex correlation structures. Functional linear mixed models that represent functional counterparts to scalar linear mixed models are applied to analyze correlated functional data. The random effects of scalar linear mixed models are replaced by functions that vary over the same domain as the observed data.

In addition to assuming independent functional observations, most existing methods are restricted to functional observation that are available at a typically large number of observation points that are the same across all curves. This strong requirement is often not met in applications, where functional observations are frequently evaluated at curve-specific--possibly few--irregularly spaced points. To overcome this restriction, special methodological emphasis of this thesis is placed on the extension of functional linear mixed models and their estimation to data that are observed on unequal grids or even sparsely.

This thesis develops a new estimation framework that addresses both complex correlation structures between functional observations as well as observations on general sampling grids. Previous work is either less general in the assumed correlation structure or does not allow for general grids and sparseness. The functional nature of the data is accounted for by expanding all model terms in the additive predictor in suitable bases. For the functional random effects, bases of functional principal components are chosen. These can be seen as natural functional extensions of multivariate principal components and thus represent the dominant modes of variation in the data. Using only the most important directions provides the dimension reduction critically important for functional data analysis. In analogy to the multivariate case, the functional principal components of the functional random effects correspond to the eigenfunctions of their respective covariance operators. How to estimate covariances of latent processes is non-trivial and thus constitutes an essential element in this thesis.

In the first two parts of this work, two novel method of moments estimators for covariances of latent processes are proposed. They differ in the generality of the assumed correlation structures and the supported sampling grids. Both covariance estimation methods involve bivariate smoothing of one or multiple covariances. In the third part, a fast symmetric bivariate smoothing approach is proposed that is particularly suited to estimate smooth covariances by taking advantage of their symmetry. Its application considerably reduces computation time and memory requirements.

The proposed modeling framework is evaluated in extensive simulation studies. The relevance of the proposed methods is highlighted in applications to data from speech production research as well as from medical studies. To allow the practical application of the methods, open-source implementations are provided in the two R add-on packages denseFLMM and sparseFLMM.},

@article{Bolker.2009,
 abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},
